datascience
===========
I am using this repository as a place for different data science related data, python and R scripts, and visualizations.
This repo will be mostly for my work on projects for the EDAV (Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization) class
I am taking at Columbia University during the Spring 2014 semester.
