datascience
===========
I am using this repository as a place for data science projects in python, R, and visualizations.
This repo includes my projects in the EDAV (Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization) class taken for the Data Sciences Certification Program at Columbia University during the Spring 2014 semester.
